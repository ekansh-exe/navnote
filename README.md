**A minimal, keyboard-driven note-taking app that lives in your terminal.**

## What is NavNote?

NavNote is a TUI (terminal user interface) note-taking app written in Go. It stores everything as plain Markdown files in `~/.navnote/` — so your notes are always yours, readable by any editor, and easy to sync with Git, Dropbox, or whatever you prefer.

No accounts. No subscriptions. No Electron. Just your terminal and your thoughts.

> 🌿Just like Bulbasaur is the best. NavNote is the best terminal notes app.

```

---

### Option 3 — Using Make

## Project Structure

```
navnote/
├── main.go       # Entry point — wires up the Bubble Tea program
├── model.go      # TUI model: struct, Init, Update, View
├── files.go      # Vault logic: init, listFiles, item type
├── styles.go     # All lipgloss styles and color variables
├── Makefile      # Build, run, install, clean targets
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── README.md
```

All files share `package main` — Go builds the whole directory together, so they freely reference each other's types and functions with no internal imports needed.

---

## Where are my notes stored?

```
~/.navnote/
├── meeting-notes.md
├── ideas.md
└── todo.md
```

Plain Markdown. Open them in Neovim, VS Code, Obsidian — whatever you want. NavNote doesn't care.
